      Here I explore the use of Euclidean, hyperbolic and mixed auto-encoder and parametric embeddings for the purpose of understanding human culture, language, scientific discovery and social networks. I begin with the case of human culture, and how dimensions induced by word differences (e.g., man – woman, rich – poor, black – white, liberal – conservative) in these vector spaces closely correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared cultural connotations when compared to surveyed responses and labeled historical data. I show how nonparametric subsample and bootstrap approaches can reveal the stability of these associations, and then demonstrate these methods in a longitudinal analysis of the coevolution of class and gender associations in the United States and Great Britain over the 20th century. Then I use embeddings to explore similarities and differences across the world's languages, which reveal that while languages tend to have similar semantic clusters, with more concrete concepts tending to be clustered the most consistently, those clusters are networked in radically different ways around the world, mapping out different organizations of meaning. Then I exemplify the use of hyperbolic embeddings for the purpose of recovering not social and semantic dimensions, but hierarchies in data on 21st Century physics. Finally, I explore the concepts of geometric curvature applied to social networks, and the meaning and potential for embedding networks with mixed positive, negative and neutral curvature for mapping out the social and cultural universes in ways resonant with our modern understanding of the physical universe.

      I will talk about elliptic curves, one of the most simple and rich mathematical object. You encounter it, when you play “Snake 2” on Nokia, snack a donut or try to prove the Fermat’s Last Theorem. Also it might help to encrypt your proof afterwards.

      We will discuss how the classic Central Limit Theorem for uncorrelated events is not the only fundamental universal statistical law appearing in nature. Random Matrix Theory (a.k.a. "noncommutative probability theory") lies on the intersection of the theory of integrable systems, probability theory, asymptotic analysis, complex analysis, orthogonal polynomials... It sheds light on many extremely relevant statistical phenomena, from nuclear physics to zeta functions. Using the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble as the simplest example, we will clarify the connections between Random Matrices and orthogonal polynomials, and sketch the derivations of the basic statistical properties of the eigenvalues.

      Exactly solvable spin models serve as crucial examples for studying topological physics.  In addition to being physically relevant for applications such as quantum computing, these models elegantly blend discrete and continuous mathematics.  In this lecture, we will explore the simplest non-trivial example: the Toric Code.
