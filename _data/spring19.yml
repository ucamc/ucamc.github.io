      There are data sets that are normal sized, data sets that are
      large, and there are those that qualify as “Big Data”. And then there are
      the humungous ones, the humungousest of which is The Universe; i.e.
      cosmological data.

      Cosmological data sets are so overwhelming that, if you look hard enough,
      you can find almost anything that you want (or do not want) to find in
      them, and this calls for the development of powerful techniques that, on
      the one hand, summarize the data in a meaningful way and, on the other
      hand, allow for distinguishing between important physical phenomena and
      those which `you just happened to see by chance’.

      Abstract mathematical concepts from the rather esoteric area of Algebraic
      Topology provide a set of techniques, for the first of these problems,
      while Probability Theory provides the second set.

      I will explain how all all three of these topics - Cosmology, Algebraic
      Topology, and Probability Theory - fit together, although I will not
      assume any prior knowledge of any of them. (i.e. Lots of pictures, hardly
      any formulae, and definitely not even an attempt at a proof (despite the
      fact that a lot of the fun is in the proofs).

      We'll talk about how a little bit of uncertainty can have extreme consequences for strategic interactions. Then, we'll show how an organization can leverage this idea to resolve coordination issues in teams.

      Here I explore the use of Euclidean, hyperbolic and mixed auto-encoder and parametric embeddings for the purpose of understanding human culture, language, scientific discovery and social networks. I begin with the case of human culture, and how dimensions induced by word differences (e.g., man – woman, rich – poor, black – white, liberal – conservative) in these vector spaces closely correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared cultural connotations when compared to surveyed responses and labeled historical data. I show how nonparametric subsample and bootstrap approaches can reveal the stability of these associations, and then demonstrate these methods in a longitudinal analysis of the coevolution of class and gender associations in the United States and Great Britain over the 20th century. Then I use embeddings to explore similarities and differences across the world's languages, which reveal that while languages tend to have similar semantic clusters, with more concrete concepts tending to be clustered the most consistently, those clusters are networked in radically different ways around the world, mapping out different organizations of meaning. Then I exemplify the use of hyperbolic embeddings for the purpose of recovering not social and semantic dimensions, but hierarchies in data on 21st Century physics. Finally, I explore the concepts of geometric curvature applied to social networks, and the meaning and potential for embedding networks with mixed positive, negative and neutral curvature for mapping out the social and cultural universes in ways resonant with our modern understanding of the physical universe.

      I will talk about elliptic curves, one of the most simple and rich mathematical object. You encounter it, when you play “Snake 2” on Nokia, snack a donut or try to prove the Fermat’s Last Theorem. Also it might help to encrypt your proof afterwards.

      We will discuss how the classic Central Limit Theorem for uncorrelated events is not the only fundamental universal statistical law appearing in nature. Random Matrix Theory (a.k.a. "noncommutative probability theory") lies on the intersection of the theory of integrable systems, probability theory, asymptotic analysis, complex analysis, orthogonal polynomials... It sheds light on many extremely relevant statistical phenomena, from nuclear physics to zeta functions. Using the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble as the simplest example, we will clarify the connections between Random Matrices and orthogonal polynomials, and sketch the derivations of the basic statistical properties of the eigenvalues.

      Exactly solvable spin models serve as crucial examples for studying topological physics.  In addition to being physically relevant for applications such as quantum computing, these models elegantly blend discrete and continuous mathematics.  In this lecture, we will explore the simplest non-trivial example: the Toric Code.
