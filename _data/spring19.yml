      We will discuss how the classic Central Limit Theorem for uncorrelated events is not the only fundamental universal statistical law appearing in nature. Random Matrix Theory (a.k.a. "noncommutative probability theory") lies on the intersection of the theory of integrable systems, probability theory, asymptotic analysis, complex analysis, orthogonal polynomials... It sheds light on many extremely relevant statistical phenomena, from nuclear physics to zeta functions. Using the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble as the simplest example, we will clarify the connections between Random Matrices and orthogonal polynomials, and sketch the derivations of the basic statistical properties of the eigenvalues.

      Exactly solvable spin models serve as crucial examples for studying topological physics.  In addition to being physically relevant for applications such as quantum computing, these models elegantly blend discrete and continuous mathematics.  In this lecture, we will explore the simplest non-trivial example: the Toric Code.
