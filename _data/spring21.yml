      For our opening talk of the quarter, Ryan Speiler will be discussing topological physics and soft matter! 
      The talk will be at the cutting-edge intersection of algebra, topology, and physics! ABSTRACT COMING! 
      Ryan is a Physics graduate student at UT Austin, and was an active member of UCAMC as an undergraduate at UChicago. 
      He stayed in Coulter house throughout his 4 years, and was an incredible mentor to countless math and physics undergraduates, including some of our board members. 
      If you would like to learn more about grad school - both applying and the experience itself - Ryan will share some incredible advice!
