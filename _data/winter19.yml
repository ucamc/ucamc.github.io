    abstract: "Most people are familiar with a number of examples of invasive species, that is, when a new species is introduced to some habitat.  In Chicago, for example, there are the Asian carp in the Chicago river and zebra mussels in Lake Michigan.  In this talk, I will go over the derivation of some basic PDE models for these invasions.  The focus will be on developing mathematical tools to understand the influence of populations to various factors (e.g., the drift of a river current, genetic variation, geographic features that "slow down" or "speed up" the species)."

    abstract: "We will talk about the forward map, which to known coefficients and sources associates solutions of equations. We will then talk about the inverse map, which roughly corresponds to the reverse direction."

    abstract: "A problem in computational modeling in all fields is that averages can involve contributions from relatively rare states and thus be slow to converge.  Stratified sampling is a long-standing approach to addressing this problem:  essentially, one samples from rare and common populations independently and then combines the information from the different populations with appropriate weights.  I will talk about a recent mathematical framework that extends the power of this approach significantly and show applications in bio-molecular simulations."

    what: The Many Applications of Eigenvalues

    abstract: "Eigenvalue analysis is one of the power tools in applied mathematics. Apart from the central role in the theory of linear dynamical systems, eigenvalue problems are among the few families of nonlinear equations and non-convex optimization problems that we know how to solve quickly and reliably on a computer.  In this talk, we describe three different applications where eigenvalue analysis plays a central role: the analysis of resonant micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), game-theoretic models of opinion formation, and the spectral analysis of networks.  In the process, we explore perturbations, approximations, nonlinearities, and the many other ways in which eigenvalue analysis touches on a wide range of mathematical topics."

    abstract: "String theory and mathematics have enjoyed a wonderful productive interplay over the past few decades. I will roughly sketch how physical mathematics uses physical reasoning to arrive at often unexpected mathematical conjectures. I’ll also try to discuss a couple of mathematics questions of current interest to the string landscape."

    what: Nonlinear Models for Matrix Completion
    when: Thursday Jan. 17th, 2019
    time: 6 PM

    abstract: "The past decade of research on matrix completion has shown it is possible to leverage linear dependencies to impute missing values in a low-rank matrix. However, the corresponding assumption that the data lies in or near a low-dimensional linear subspace is not always met in practice. Extending matrix completion theory and algorithms to exploit low-dimensional nonlinear structure in data will allow missing data imputation in a far richer class of problems. In this talk, I will describe how models of low-dimensional nonlinear structure can be used for matrix completion. In particular, we will explore matrix completion in the context of unions of subspaces, in which data points lie in or near one of several subspaces, and nonlinear algebraic varieties, a polynomial generalization of classical linear subspaces. Low Algebraic-Dimension Matrix Completion (LADMC) is a novel and efficient method for imputing missing values and admits new bounds on the amount of missing data that can be accurately imputed. Theproposed algorithms are able to recover synthetically generated data up to predicted sample complexity bounds and outperform standard low-rank matrix completion in experiments with real motion capture data. This is joint work with Daniel Pimentel-Alarcon, Gregory Ongie, Laura Balzano, and Robert Nowak."

    what: How my research in pattern formation led to some virtual travel via Google Maps

    abstract: "Studying how spatial patterns form, spontaneously, in nonlinear dynamical systems has a long tradition in physics and applied math, and takes a lot of its inspiration from nature. I will describe an example of this from my own research, where we investigated large-scale patterns of vegetation in dry-land ecosystems that self-organize, in response to aridity stress, at a community scale. We  investigated the dynamics, or time-evolution, of the vegetation on timescales of decades by aligning modern satellite images with old aerial survey photographs from  the 1950s. Our armchair explorations were so much fun for me. I’ll show a lot of pictures from our virtual travels, and describe some of the mathematics that led us to take these journeys."
