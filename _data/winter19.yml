    abstract: "Studying how spatial patterns form, spontaneously, in nonlinear dynamical systems has a long tradition in physics and applied math, and takes a lot of its inspiration from nature. I will describe an example of this from my own research, where we investigated large-scale patterns of vegetation in dry-land ecosystems that self-organize, in response to aridity stress, at a community scale. We  investigated the dynamics, or time-evolution, of the vegetation on timescales of decades by aligning modern satellite images with old aerial survey photographs from  the 1950s. Our armchair explorations were so much fun for me. Iâ€™ll show a lot of pictures from our virtual travels, and describe some of the mathematics that led us to take these journeys."
